In this repository, we post the Python codes that implement the MPC algorithm for linear systems. In the tutorial page given below, we explain how to develop the MPC algorithm from scratch:

https://aleksandarhaber.com/model-predictive-control-mpc-tutorial-1-unconstrained-formulation-derivation-and-implementation-in-python-from-scratch/

Explanation of posted code files:

- "driverCodeMPC.py" is the driver code for the MPC algorithm
- "ModelPredictiveControl.py" is the code file that implements the MPC algorithm in Python
- "functionMPC.py"  is the code file that implements the function for calculating the response of the system

The performance of the MPC algorithm for tracking a pulse trajectory is given below.
